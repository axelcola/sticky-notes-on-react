<h1>Sticky Notes App with React JS</h1>
Check out the final result [here](https://axelcola.github.io/sticky-notes-on-react/)

I worked on this page to put into practice my knowledge of Html, Css, Javascript and bootstrap.

This is a list of functions that the page should have that I got on the internet:

• As user, I can create a new Post it.

• As user, I can see all the Posts in the workspace.
